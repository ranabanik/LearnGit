So I just created a folder:
C:\Users\ranab\PycharmProjects\LearnGit

from Git bash entered the folder and created this .txt file. 

(base)
ranab@banikr MINGW64 ~/PycharmProjects/LearnGit (master)
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/ranab/PycharmProjects/LearnGit/.git/
(base)
ranab@banikr MINGW64 ~/PycharmProjects/LearnGit (master)
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        DemoCode.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
(base)
ranab@banikr MINGW64 ~/PycharmProjects/LearnGit (master)
